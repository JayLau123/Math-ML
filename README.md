# Introduction

**PAC(Probably Approximately Correct) learning model**. Find a good model with a high probability

$$P(|f(x)-y| \leq \epsilon) \geq 1-\delta$$

Science, Technology, Engineering

Science: what, why

Technology: how

Engineering: reduce the cost, improve the effiency, industrialization

What is Machine Learning: Using experience to improve the performance of the system.《Machine Learning》T.Mitchell


Summarize knowledge from experience, experience comes from information, information comes from data, data contains knowledge, knowledge contains wisdom.
从经验里面总结出知识，经验来自信息，信息来自数据，数据里面蕴藏着知识，知识里面还有智慧

Data—information—knowledge—wisdom, with knowledge and wisdom, improve efficiency, create value, and increase productivity
数据——信息——知识——智慧，有了知识和智慧，提高效率，创造价值，提高生产力

**AI & ML: data, algorithm, computational resource**

The optimization and progress of the model requires experience, which is stored and disseminated in the form of data in computers and the Internet
